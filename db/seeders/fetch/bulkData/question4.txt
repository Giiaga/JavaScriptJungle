This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n&gt; Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.\r\n&gt; - It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively &quot;unsafe&quot; actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).\r\n&gt; - It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.\r\n\r\nAlso note you can apply &quot;strict mode&quot; to the whole file...

I was hoping to edit the most popular answer, but failed. I tried to make it as comprehensive and complete as I could.\r\n\r\nYou can refer to the [MDN documentation][1] for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n`&quot;use strict&quot;` a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.\r\n\r\nDirectives are similar to statements, yet different.\r\n\r\n - `use strict` does not contain key words: The directive is a simple expression statement, which consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes). JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce `use` as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete.\r\n - `use strict` can be used only at the beginning of a script or of a function, i.e. it must precede every other (real) statement. It does not have to be the first instruction in a script of function: it can be preceded by other statement expressions that consist of string literals ( and JavaScript implementations can treat them as implementation specific directives). String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect.\r\n\r\nThe `use strict` directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.\r\nThe code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a `use strict` directive.\r\nThe content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a `use strict` directive.\r\nCode that is passed to an `eval()` method is considered strict code when `eval()` was called from a strict code or contains the `use strict` directive itself.\r\n\r\nThe strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):\r\n\r\n - You cannot use the `with`-statement in strict mode.\r\n - In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global `Object`, then you will get a `ReferenceError`. In normal mode the identifier is implicitly declared as a global variable (as a property of the global `Object`)\r\n - In strict mode the keyword `this` has the value `undefined` in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). (In normal mode `this` always points to the global `Object`). This difference can be used to test if an implementation supports the strict mode:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;     var hasStrictMode = (function() { &quot;use strict&quot;; return this===undefined }());\r\n\r\n - Also when a function is invoked with `call()` or `apply` in strict mode, then `this` is exactly the value of the first argument of the `call()`or `apply()` invocation. (In normal mode `null` and `undefined` are replaced by the global `Object` and values, which are not objects, are cast into objects.)\r\n\r\n - In strict mode you will get a `TypeError`, when you try to assign to readonly properties or to define new properties for a non extensible object. (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.)\r\n - In strict mode, when passing code to `eval()`, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode). Instead, a new scope is created for `eval()` and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after `eval()` finishes execution.\r\n - In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat &quot;magical&quot; behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value.\r\n - In strict mode you will get a `SyntaxError` when the `delete` operator is followed by a non qualified identifier (a variable, function or function parameter). In normal mode the `delete` expression would do nothing and is evaluated to `false`.\r\n - In strict mode you will get a `TypeError` when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the `delete` expression is evaluated to `false`).\r\n - In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.)\r\n - In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.)\r\n - In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with `0x`. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.)\r\n - In strict mode the identifiers `eval` and `arguments` are treated like keywords. You cannot change their value, cannot assign a value to them, and you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, function parameters or identifiers of a catch block.\r\n - In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack. `arguments.caller` and `arguments.callee` cause a `TypeError` in a function in strict mode. Furthermore, some caller- and arguments properties of functions in strict mode cause a `TypeError` when you try to read them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"},{"score":58,"body_markdown":"When adding `&quot;use strict&quot;;`, the following cases will throw a **SyntaxError** before the script is executing:\r\n\r\n- _Paving the way for future ECMAScript versions_, using one of the newly reserved keywords (in prevision for _ECMAScript 6_): `implements`, `interface`, `let`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, `public`, `static`, and `yield`.\r\n\r\n- Declaring function in blocks \r\n      \r\n        if(a&lt;b){ function f(){} }\r\n\r\n- Octal syntax \r\n       \r\n        var n = 023;\r\n\r\n- `this` point to the global object.\r\n\r\n         function f() {\r\n              &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n              this.a = 1;\r\n         };\r\n         f(); \r\n\r\n- Declaring twice the same name for a property name in an object literal \r\n\r\n         {a: 1, b: 3, a: 7} \r\nThis is no longer the case in ECMAScript 6 ([bug 1041128](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041128)).\r\n\r\n- Declaring two function arguments with the same name function \r\n          \r\n        f(a, b, b){}\r\n\r\n- Setting a value to an undeclared variable\r\n\r\n        function f(x){\r\n           &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n           var a = 12;\r\n           b = a + x*35; // error!\r\n        }\r\n        f();\r\n\r\n- Using `delete` on a variable name `delete myVariable;`\r\n- Using `eval` or `arguments` as variable or function argument name\r\n\r\n        &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n        arguments++;\r\n        var obj = { set p(arguments) { } };\r\n        try { } catch (arguments) { }\r\n        function arguments() { } \r\n\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n * [Transitioning to strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode/Transitioning_to_strict_mode) on MDN\r\n\r\n * [Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) on MDN\r\n\r\n * [JavaScript’s Strict Mode and Why You Should Use It](http://web.archive.org/web/20170707015027/http://cjihrig.com/blog/javascripts-strict-mode-and-why-you-should-use-it/) on Colin J.

Or, insert a `&#39;use strict&#39;;` statement on top of your function body:\r\n\r\n        function doSomething() {\r\n            &#39;use strict&#39;;\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Everything in the *lexical scope* of function `doSomething` will be interpreted in strict mode. The word *lexical scope* is important here. For example, if your *strict* code calls a function of a library that is *not strict*, only your code is executed in strict mode, and not the called function. See [this answer][4] for a better explanation.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWhat things are prohibited in strict mode?\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI found a [nice article][5] describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exclusive list):\r\n\r\n&gt; Scope\r\n&gt; -----\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions\r\n&gt; are scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some\r\n&gt; features make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is\r\n&gt; confusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.\r\n&gt; Misunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.\r\n&gt; Static scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile\r\n&gt; time, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be\r\n&gt; deferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance\r\n&gt; penalty.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.\r\n&gt; That means that the features that previously required dynamic binding\r\n&gt; must be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is\r\n&gt; eliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the\r\n&gt; environment of its caller is severely restricted.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)\r\n&gt; can do a better job when processing it.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Implied Global Variables\r\n&gt; -----\r\n&gt; JavaScript has implied global variables. If\r\n&gt; you do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is\r\n&gt; implicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for\r\n&gt; beginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping\r\n&gt; chores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more\r\n&gt; difficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict\r\n&gt; mode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should\r\n&gt; explicitly declare all of your variables.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Global Leakage\r\n&gt; -----\r\n&gt; There are a number of situations that could cause `this`\r\n&gt; to be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to\r\n&gt; provide the `new` prefix when calling a constructor function, the\r\n&gt; constructor&#39;s `this` will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so\r\n&gt; instead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently\r\n&gt; tampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will\r\n&gt; instead bind `this` to `undefined`, which will cause the constructor to\r\n&gt; throw an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much\r\n&gt; sooner.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Noisy Failure\r\n&gt; -----\r\n&gt; JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you\r\n&gt; could not create them yourself until ES5’s `Object.createProperty`\r\n&gt; function exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value\r\n&gt; to a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would\r\n&gt; not change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as\r\n&gt; though it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to\r\n&gt; go into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a\r\n&gt; read-only property will throw an exception.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Octal\r\n&gt; -----\r\n&gt; The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely\r\n&gt; useful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word\r\n&gt; sizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC\r\n&gt; 6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read\r\n&gt; octal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented\r\n&gt; the op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the\r\n&gt; slow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was\r\n&gt; thought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was\r\n&gt; selected: Leading zero. So in C, `0100` means 64, not 100, and `08` is an\r\n&gt; error, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been\r\n&gt; copied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where\r\n&gt; it is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in\r\n&gt; strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Et cetera\r\n&gt; -----\r\n&gt; The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more\r\n&gt; array-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its `callee` and `caller`\r\n&gt; properties. This makes it possible to pass your `arguments` to untrusted\r\n&gt; code without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the\r\n&gt; `arguments` property of functions is eliminated.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a\r\n&gt; syntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.\r\n&gt; A function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its\r\n&gt; parameters. A function can’t `delete` its own variables. An attempt to\r\n&gt; `delete` a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive\r\n&gt; values are not implicitly wrapped.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nReserved words for future JavaScript versions\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:\r\n\r\n&gt; `implements`, `interface`, `let`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, `public`, `static`, and `yield`\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n - [Strict Mode - JavaScript | MDN][1]\r\n - [Browser support for strict mode][6]\r\n - [Transitioning to strict mode][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode\r\n  [2]: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27114400/1461424\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6039163/1461424\r\n  [5]: http://yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/\r\n  [6]: http://caniuse.com/#feat=use-strict\r\n  [7]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode/Transitioning_to_strict_mode"},{"score":19,"body_markdown":"Note that `use strict` was introduced in [EcmaScript 5][1] and was kept since then.\r\n\r\nBelow are the conditions to trigger strict mode in [ES6][2] and [ES7][3]:\r\n\r\n&gt;  - Global code is strict mode code if it begins with a Directive    Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive (see 14.1.1).\r\n&gt;  - Module code is always strict mode code.\r\n&gt;  - All parts of a *ClassDeclaration* or a *ClassExpression* are strict mode    code.\r\n&gt;  - Eval code is strict mode code if it begins with a Directive Prologue    that contains a Use Strict Directive or if the call to eval is a direct eval (see 12.3.4.1) that is contained in strict mode code.\r\n&gt;  - Function code is strict mode code if the associated *FunctionDeclaration, FunctionExpression, GeneratorDeclaration, GeneratorExpression, MethodDefinition, or ArrowFunction* is contained in strict mode code or if the code that produces the value of the function’s [[ECMAScriptCode]] internal slot begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.\r\n&gt;  - Function code that is supplied as the arguments to the built-in    Function and Generator constructors is strict mode code if the last argument is a String that when processed is a *FunctionBody* that begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode\r\n  [2]: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-strict-mode-code\r\n  [3]: https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-strict-mode-code"},{"score":12,"body_markdown":"&quot;use strict&quot;; is the ECMA effort to make JavaScript a little bit more robust.
