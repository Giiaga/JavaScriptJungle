This means you can tell the scope of an identifier by looking at the source code.\r\n\r\nThe four scopes are:\r\n\r\n1. Global - visible by everything\r\n2. Function - visible within a function (and its sub-functions and blocks)\r\n3. Block - visible within a block (and its sub-blocks)\r\n4. Module - visible within a module\r\n\r\nOutside of the special cases of global and module scope, variables are declared using `var` (function scope), `let` (block scope), and `const` (block scope). Most other forms of identifier declaration have block scope in strict mode.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nScope is the region of the codebase over which an identifier is valid.\r\n\r\nA lexical environment is a mapping between identifier names and the values associated with them.\r\n\r\nScope is formed of a linked nesting of lexical environments, with each level in the nesting corresponding to a lexical environment of an ancestor execution context.\r\n\r\nThese linked lexical environments form a scope &quot;chain&quot;. Identifier resolution is the process of searching along this chain for a matching identifier.\r\n\r\nIdentifier resolution only occurs in one direction: outwards. In this way, outer lexical environments cannot &quot;see&quot; into inner lexical environments.\r\n\r\nThere are three pertinent factors in deciding the [scope][1] of an [identifier][2] in JavaScript:\r\n\r\n1. How an identifier was declared\r\n2. Where an identifier was declared\r\n3. Whether you are in [strict mode][3] or [non-strict mode][4]\r\n\r\nSome of the ways identifiers can be declared:\r\n\r\n1. `var`, `let` and `const`\r\n2. Function parameters\r\n9. Catch block parameter\r\n3. Function declarations\r\n4. Named function expressions\r\n5. Implicitly defined properties on the global object (i.e., missing out `var` in non-strict mode)\r\n6. `import` statements\r\n8. `eval`\r\n\r\nSome of the locations identifiers can be declared:\r\n\r\n1. Global context\r\n2. Function body\r\n4. Ordinary block\r\n5. The top of a control structure (e.g., loop, if, while, etc.)\r\n6. Control structure body\r\n7. Modules\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Declaration Styles&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;var&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nIdentifiers declared using `var` **have function scope**, apart from when they are declared directly in the global context, in which case they are added as properties on the global object and have global scope. There are separate rules for their use in `eval` functions.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;let and const&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nIdentifiers declared using `let` and `const` **have block scope**, apart from when they are declared directly in the global context, in which case they have global scope.\r\n\r\nNote: `let`, `const` and `var` [are all hoisted][5]. This means that their logical position of definition is the top of their enclosing scope (block or function). However, variables declared using `let` and `const` cannot be read or assigned to until control has passed the point of declaration in the source code. The interim period is known as the temporal dead zone.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function f() {\r\n        function g() {\r\n            console.log(x)\r\n        }\r\n        let x = 1\r\n        g()\r\n    }\r\n    f() // 1 because x is hoisted even though declared with `let`!\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Function parameter names&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nFunction parameter names are scoped to the function body. Note that there is a slight complexity to this. Functions declared as default arguments close over the [parameter list][6], and not the body of the function.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Function declarations&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nFunction declarations have block scope in strict mode and function scope in non-strict mode. Note: non-strict mode is a complicated set of emergent rules based on the quirky historical implementations of different browsers.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Named function expressions&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nNamed function expressions are scoped to themselves (e.g., for the purpose of recursion).\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Implicitly defined properties on the global object&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nIn non-strict mode, implicitly defined properties on the global object have global scope, because the global object sits at the top of the scope chain. In strict mode, these are not permitted.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;eval&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nIn `eval` strings, variables declared using `var` will be placed in the current scope, or, if `eval` is used indirectly, as properties on the global object.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe following will throw a ReferenceError because the names`x`, `y`, and `z` have no meaning outside of the function `f`.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function f() {\r\n        var x = 1\r\n        let y = 1\r\n        const z = 1\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(typeof x) // undefined (because var has function scope!)\r\n    console.log(typeof y) // undefined (because the body of the function is a block)\r\n    console.log(typeof z) // undefined (because the body of the function is a block)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe following will throw a ReferenceError for `y` and `z`, but not for `x`, because the visibility of `x` is not constrained by the block. Blocks that define the bodies of control structures like `if`, `for`, and `while`, behave similarly.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        var x = 1\r\n        let y = 1\r\n        const z = 1\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(x) // 1\r\n    console.log(typeof y) // undefined because `y` has block scope\r\n    console.log(typeof z) // undefined because `z` has block scope\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the following, `x` is visible outside of the loop because `var` has function scope:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    for(var x = 0; x &lt; 5; ++x) {}\r\n    console.log(x) // 5 (note this is outside the loop!)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n...because of this behavior, you need to be careful about closing over variables declared using `var` in loops. There is only one instance of variable `x` declared here, and it sits logically outside of the loop.\r\n\r\nThe following prints `5`, five times, and then prints `5` a sixth time for the `console.log` outside the loop:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    for(var x = 0; x &lt; 5; ++x) {\r\n        setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(x)) // closes over the `x` which is logically positioned at the top of the enclosing scope, above the loop\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(x) // note: visible outside the loop\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe following prints `undefined` because `x` is block-scoped. The callbacks are run one by one asynchronously. New behavior for `let` variables means that each anonymous function closed over a different variable named `x` (unlike it would have done with `var`), and so integers `0` through `4` are printed.:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    for(let x = 0; x &lt; 5; ++x) {\r\n        setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(x)) // `let` declarations are re-declared on a per-iteration basis, so the closures capture different variables\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(typeof x) // undefined\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe following will NOT throw a `ReferenceError` because the visibility of `x` is not constrained by the block; it will, however, print `undefined` because the variable has not been initialised (because of the `if` statement).\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    if(false) {\r\n        var x = 1\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(x) // here, `x` has been declared, but not initialised\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nA variable declared at the top of a `for` loop using `let` is scoped to the body of the loop:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    for(let x = 0; x &lt; 10; ++x) {} \r\n    console.log(typeof x) // undefined, because `x` is block-scoped\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe following will throw a `ReferenceError` because the visibility of `x` is constrained by the block:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    if(false) {\r\n        let x = 1\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(typeof x) // undefined, because `x` is block-scoped\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nVariables declared using `var`, `let` or `const` are all scoped to modules:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// module1.js\r\n\r\nvar x = 0\r\nexport function f() {}\r\n\r\n//module2.js\r\n\r\nimport f from &#39;module1.js&#39;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(x) // throws ReferenceError\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following will declare a property on the global object because variables declared using `var` within the global context are added as properties to the global object:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var x = 1\r\n    console.log(window.hasOwnProperty(&#39;x&#39;)) // true\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n`let` and `const` in the global context do not add properties to the global object, but still have global scope:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let x = 1\r\n    console.log(window.hasOwnProperty(&#39;x&#39;)) // false\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nFunction parameters can be considered to be declared in the function body:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function f(x) {}\r\n    console.log(typeof x) // undefined, because `x` is scoped to the function\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nCatch block parameters are scoped to the catch-block body:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    try {} catch(e) {}\r\n    console.log(typeof e) // undefined, because `e` is scoped to the catch block\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNamed function expressions are scoped only to the expression itself:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    (function foo() { console.log(foo) })()\r\n    console.log(typeof foo) // undefined, because `foo` is scoped to its own expression\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nIn non-strict mode, implicitly defined properties on the global object are globally scoped.

This method creates a new execution context and establishes a link between the new execution context and the lexical environment of the function-object. It does this by copying the `[[Environment]]` value on the function-object, into an [outer reference][8] field on the lexical environment of the new execution context.\r\n\r\nNote that this link between the new execution context and the lexical environment of the function object is called a [closure][10].\r\n\r\nThus, in JavaScript, scope is implemented via lexical environments linked together in a &quot;chain&quot; by outer references. This chain of lexical environments is called the scope chain, and identifier resolution occurs by [searching up the chain][11] for a matching identifier.\r\n\r\nFind out [more][12].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)\r\n  [2]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-names-and-keywords\r\n  [3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode\r\n  [4]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode\r\n  [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31222689/38522\r\n  [6]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61208843/where-are-arguments-positioned-in-the-lexical-environment/\r\n  [7]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1047479/38522\r\n  [8]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-lexical-environments\r\n  [9]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-execution-contexts\r\n  [10]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/111114/38522\r\n  [11]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-getidentifierreference\r\n  [12]: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed/scope-closures"},{"score":26,"body_markdown":"In &quot;Javascript 1.7&quot; (Mozilla&#39;s extension to Javascript) one can also declare block-scope variables with [`let` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#section_11):\r\n\r\n     var a = 4;\r\n     let (a = 3) {\r\n       alert(a); // 3\r\n     }\r\n     alert(a);   // 4"},{"score":31,"body_markdown":"The key, as I understand it, is that Javascript has function level scoping vs the more common C block scoping.\r\n\r\n[Here is a good article on the subject.][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting"},{"score":9,"body_markdown":"I found that many people new to JavaScript have trouble understanding that inheritance is available by default in the language and that function scope is the only scope, so far.

There was a master card referred to as the background. It was transparent and can be seen as the bottom card. Any content on this base card was shared with cards placed on top of it. Each card placed on top had its own content which took precedence over the previous card, but still had access to the prior cards if desired.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly how the JavaScript scoping system is designed. It just has different names. The cards in JavaScript are known as **[Execution Contexts&lt;sup&gt;ECMA&lt;/sup&gt;](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-10.3)**. Each one of these contexts contains three main parts. A variable environment, a lexical environment, and a this binding. Going back to the cards reference, the lexical environment contains all of the content from prior cards lower in the stack. The current context is at the top of the stack and any content declared there will be stored in the variable environment. The variable environment will take precedence in the case of naming collisions.\r\n\r\nThe this binding will point to the containing object. Sometimes scopes or execution contexts change without the containing object changing, such as in a declared function where the containing object may be `window` or a constructor function.\r\n\r\nThese execution contexts are created any time control is transferred. Control is transferred when code begins to execute, and this is primarily done from function execution. \r\n\r\nSo that is the technical explanation. In practice, it is important to remember that in JavaScript\r\n\r\n - Scopes are technically &quot;Execution Contexts&quot;\r\n - Contexts form a stack of environments where variables are stored\r\n - The top of the stack takes precedence (the bottom being the global context)\r\n - Each function creates an execution context (but not always a new this binding)\r\n\r\nApplying this to one of the previous examples (5. &quot;Closure&quot;) on this page, it is possible to follow the stack of execution contexts. In this example there are three contexts in the stack. They are defined by the outer context, the context in the immediately invoked function called by var six, and the context in the returned function inside of var six&#39;s immediately invoked function.\r\n\r\n *i*) The outer context. It has a variable environment of a = 1  \r\n *ii*) The IIFE context, it has a lexical environment of a = 1, but a variable environment of a = 6 which takes precedence in the stack  \r\n *iii*) The returned function context, it has a lexical environment of a = 6 and that is the value referenced in the alert when called.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/v45hL.png"},{"score":-3,"body_markdown":" There are two types of scopes in JavaScript. \r\n\r\n1.\t**Global scope**: variable which is announced in global scope can be used anywhere in the program very smoothly.

That explains why for-loops overwrite outer scoped variables:\r\n\r\n    var i = 10, v = 10;\r\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { var v = 5; }\r\n    console.log(i, v);\r\n    // output 5 5\r\n\r\nUsing functions instead:\r\n\r\n    var i = 10, v = 10;\r\n    $.each([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], function(i) { var v = 5; });\r\n    console.log(i,v);\r\n    // output 10 10\r\n\r\nIn the first example, there was no block scope, so the initially declared variables were overwritten. In the second example, there was a new scope due to the function, so the initially declared variables were SHADOWED, and not overwritten.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s almost all you need to know in terms of JavaScript scoping, except:\r\n\r\n* try/catch introduce new scope ONLY for the exception variable itself, other variables do not have new scope\r\n* with-clause apparently is another exception, but using with-clause it highly discouraged (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with)\r\n\r\nSo you can see JavaScript scoping is actually extremely simple, albeit not always intuitive. A few things to be aware of:\r\n\r\n* var declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope. This means no matter where the var declaration happens, to the compiler it is as if the var itself happens at the top\r\n* multiple var declarations within the same scope are combined\r\n\r\nSo this code:\r\n\r\n    var i = 1;\r\n    function abc() {\r\n      i = 2;\r\n      var i = 3;\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(i);     // outputs 1\r\n\r\nis equivalent to:\r\n\r\n    var i = 1;\r\n    function abc() {\r\n      var i;     // var declaration moved to the top of the scope\r\n      i = 2;\r\n      i = 3;     // the assignment stays where it is\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(i);\r\n\r\nThis may seem counter intuitive, but it makes sense from the perspective of a imperative language designer."},{"score":77,"body_markdown":"# Old school JavaScript\n\nTraditionally, JavaScript really only has two types of scope : \n\n 1. **Global Scope** : Variables are known throughout the application, from the start of the application *(\\*)*\n 2. **Functional Scope** : Variables are known within [**the function**][1] they are declared in, from the start of the function *(\\*)*\n\nI will not elaborate on this, since there are already many other answers explaining the difference.\n\n-------\n\n# Modern JavaScript\n\nThe [**most recent JavaScript specs**][2] now also allow a third scope :\n\n3. **Block Scope** : Identifiers are &quot;known&quot; [from the top of the scope they are declared within][3], but they cannot be assigned to or dereferenced (read) until after the line of their declaration.

Yet, our variable `i` is known in the entire function.\n\nAlso, consider that block scoped variables are not known before they are declared because they are not hoisted. You&#39;re also not allowed to redeclare the same block scoped variable within the same block. This makes block scoped variables less error prone than globally or functionally scoped variables, which are hoisted and which do not produce any errors in case of multiple declarations.\n\n------\n\n### Is it safe to use block scope variables today?\n\nWhether or not it is safe to use today, depends on your environment :\n\n- If you&#39;re writing server-side JavaScript code ([**Node.js**][5]), you can safely use the `let` statement.\n\n- If you&#39;re writing client-side JavaScript code and use a browser based transpiler (like [**Traceur**][6] or [**babel-standalone**][7]), you can safely use the `let` statement, however your code is likely to be anything but optimal with respect to performance.\n\n- If you&#39;re writing client-side JavaScript code and use a Node based transpiler (like the [**traceur shell script**][8] or [**Babel**][9]), you can safely use the `let` statement. And because your browser will only know about the transpiled code, performance drawbacks should be limited.\n\n- If you&#39;re writing client-side JavaScript code and don&#39;t use a transpiler, you need to consider browser support.\n\n    These are some browsers that don&#39;t support `let` at all :\n    - **Internet explorer 10** and below\n    - **Firefox 43** and below\n    - **Safari 9** and below\n    - **Android browser 4** and below\n    - **Opera 27** and below\n    - **Chome 40** and below\n    - ANY version of **Opera Mini** &amp; **Blackberry Browser**\n    \n[![enter image description here][10]][10]\n\n------\n\n### How to keep track of browser support\n\nFor an up-to-date overview of which browsers support the `let` statement at the time of your reading this answer, see [**this `Can I Use` page**][11].\n\n------\n\n*(\\*) Globally and functionally scoped variables can be initialized and used before they are declared because JavaScript variables are [**hoisted**][12].* This means that declarations are always much to the top of the scope.\n\n\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function\n  [2]: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/es6-whats-new-next-version-javascript/\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31222689/38522\n  [4]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block\n  [5]: https://nodejs.org/en/\n  [6]: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler\n  [7]: https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone\n  [8]: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/Compiling-Offline\n  [9]: https://babeljs.io/\n  [10]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/J9kEC.png\n  [11]: http://caniuse.com/#search=let\n  [12]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting"},{"score":9,"body_markdown":"Just to add to the other answers, scope is a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

This is what is meant with lexical scope, we can see in the code where this function was defined and thus can determine the scope chain by merely looking at the code.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n--------\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    // global scope\r\n    var foo = &#39;global&#39;;\r\n    var bar = &#39;global&#39;;\r\n    var foobar = &#39;global&#39;;\r\n\r\n    function outerFunc () {\r\n     // outerFunc scope\r\n     var foo = &#39;outerFunc&#39;;\r\n     var foobar = &#39;outerFunc&#39;;\r\n     innerFunc();\r\n     \r\n     function innerFunc(){\r\n     // innerFunc scope\r\n      var foo = &#39;innerFunc&#39;;\r\n      console.log(foo);\r\n      console.log(bar);\r\n      console.log(foobar);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    outerFunc();\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat happens when we are trying to log the variables `foo`, `bar`, and `foobar` to the console is the following:\r\n\r\n 1. We try to log foo to the console, foo can be found inside the function `innerFunc` itself. Therefore, the value of foo is resolved to the string `innerFunc`.\r\n 2. We try to log bar to the console, bar cannot be found inside the function `innerFunc` itself. Therefore, we need to **climb the scope chain**. We first look in the outer function in which the function `innerFunc` was defined. This is the function `outerFunc`. In the scope of `outerFunc` we can find the variable bar, which holds the string &#39;outerFunc&#39;. \r\n 3. foobar cannot be found in innerFunc. . Therefore, we need to **climb the scope chain** to the innerFunc scope. It also cannot be found here, we climb another level to the **global scope** (i.e. the outermost scope). We find the variable foobar here which holds the string &#39;global&#39;. If it wouldnot have found the variable after climbing the scope chain the JS engine would throw a **referenceError**.\r\n\r\n`ES6` (ES 2015) and older:\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe same concepts of lexically scope and scopechain still apply in `ES6`. However a new ways to declare variables were introduced. There are the following:\r\n\r\n - `let`: creates a block scoped variable\r\n - `const`: creates a block scoped variable which has to be initialized and cannot be reassigned\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between `var` and `let`/`const` is that `var` is function scoped whereas `let`/`const` are block scoped. Here is an example to illustrate this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let letVar = &#39;global&#39;;\r\n    var varVar = &#39;global&#39;;\r\n\r\n    function foo () {\r\n      \r\n      if (true) {\r\n        // this variable declared with let is scoped to the if block, block scoped\r\n        let letVar = 5;\r\n        // this variable declared with let is scoped to the function block, function scoped\r\n        var varVar = 10;\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      console.log(letVar);\r\n      console.log(varVar);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    foo();\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the above example letVar logs the value global because variables declared with `let` are block scoped. They cease to exist outside their respective block, so the variable can&#39;t be accessed outside the if block. \r\n\r\n"},{"score":2,"body_markdown":"A very common issue not described yet that front-end coders often run into is the scope that is visible to an inline event handler in the HTML - for example, with\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;button onclick=&quot;foo()&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe scope of the variables that an `on*` attribute can reference *must* be either:\r\n\r\n* global (working inline handlers almost always reference global variables)\r\n* a property of the document (eg, `querySelector` as a standalone variable will point to `document.querySelector`; rare)\r\n* a property of the element the handler is attached to (like above; rare)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you&#39;ll get a ReferenceError when the handler is invoked. So, for example, if the inline handler references a function which is defined *inside* `window.onload` or `$(function() {`, the reference will fail, because the inline handler may only reference variables in the global scope, and the function is not global:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n      function foo() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;foo running&#39;);\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;button onclick=&quot;foo()&quot;&gt;click&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nProperties of the `document` and properties of the element the handler is attached to may also be referenced as standalone variables inside inline handlers because inline handlers are invoked [*inside* of two `with` blocks](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTDB0.png), one for the `document`, one for the element. The scope chain of variables inside these handlers is [extremely unintuitive](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57048067), and a working event handler will *probably* require a function to be global (and unnecessary global pollution [should probably be avoided](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/148108)).\r\n\r\nSince the scope chain inside inline handlers is *so weird*, and since inline handlers require global pollution to work, and since inline handlers sometimes require ugly string escaping when passing arguments, it&#39;s probably easier to avoid them. Instead, attach event handlers using Javascript (like with `addEventListener`), rather than with HTML markup.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n      console.log(&#39;foo running&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n    document.querySelector(&#39;.my-button&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, foo);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;button class=&quot;my-button&quot;&gt;click&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a different note, unlike normal `&lt;script&gt;` tags, which run on the top level, code inside ES6 modules runs in its own private scope. A variable defined at the top of a normal `&lt;script&gt;` tag is global, so you can reference it in other `&lt;script&gt;` tags, like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    const foo = &#39;foo&#39;;\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    console.log(foo);\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nBut the top level of an ES6 module is *not* global. A variable declared at the top of an ES6 module will only be visible inside that module, unless the variable is explicitly `export`ed, or unless it&#39;s assigned to a property of the global object.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;\r\n    const foo = &#39;foo&#39;;\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    // Can&#39;t access foo here, because the other script is a module\r\n    console.log(typeof foo);\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe top level of an ES6 module is similar to that of the inside of an IIFE on the top level in a normal `&lt;script&gt;`. The module can reference any variables which are global, and nothing can reference anything inside the module unless the module is explicitly designed for it."},{"score":0,"body_markdown":"I really like the accepted answer but I want to add this:\r\n\r\n**Scope collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.** \r\n\r\nScope is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name.\r\n \r\n\r\n - If a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, Engine consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until is found or until the outermost (a.k.a., global) scope has been reached. \r\n - Is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked up.

Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly created global of that name (if not in Strict Mode), or a ReferenceError (if in Strict Mode).\r\n - scope consists of a series of “bubbles” that each act as a container or bucket, in which identifiers (variables, functions) are declared. These bubbles nest neatly inside each other, and this nesting is defined at author time.\r\n"}],"score":2061}
